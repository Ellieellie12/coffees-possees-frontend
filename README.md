### Future Plans for Coffees & Posses
- Implement google maps api so that users will be able to search up the exact location of the coffeeshop where the club meeting will be held.
- Add a calendar within the application for users to be able to select a date and time for the club.
- Track how many users are in a club.
- Add club categories for the user to select.
